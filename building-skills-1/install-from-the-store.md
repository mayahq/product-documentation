# Install skills/modules from store

As we specified in [Brains, Modules and Skills](https://docs.mayahq.com/product/brains-modules-and-skills), you can install as many skills from store as you want. In this tutorial we'll demonstrate how you can install skills as well as modules from the store.

## Installing Modules

### Directly from store

Let's divide this into three steps -&#x20;

1. Opening the store and finding the module
2. Selecting a brain to install the module in
3. Configuring the module

#### Opening the store and finding the module

Click on the "Store" link in the left menu of the Maya desktop app to go to store, and then click "Modules" in the category list on the left of the store section. You will see a list of modules.&#x20;

Find the module you wish to install (by either searching for it or narrowing down your search by selecting categories from the left menu), and click on it.

#### Selecting a brain to install the module in

After clicking on the module, you should see a dialogue box asking you to select a brain to install the module in. You can either select one from the list, or create a new one on the spot.

#### Configuring the module

Since it's a sufficiently big topic by itself, we explain module configuration in detail [here](https://docs.mayahq.com/tutorials/configure-modules), including what a configuration profile means, how to reconfigure and how your data is stored.

After you configure the module, click the "Install Now" button to add it to the selected brain. The installation process can take a while.

### From inside a brain

You can also install a module from inside the brain, allowing you to focus on building your skill. In this case, we can divide the installation process into two steps -&#x20;

1. Opening the store and finding the module
2. Configuring the module

Since we're doing this from inside the brain, we no longer need to select a brain to install it in - it will automatically be installed inside the brain we're currently in.

#### Opening the store and finding the module

Click on the "Menu" button at the top right of the editor, click on store and then select "Modules" in the categories section to see a list of modules. From here you can filter and search for modules just like we did when installing directly from store.

As you can see, we do not need to select which brain to install the module in - the currently open brain is chosen automatically.

#### Configuring the module

Again, since it's a sufficiently big topic by itself, we explain module configuration in detail [here](https://docs.mayahq.com/tutorials/configure-modules), including what a configuration profile means, how to reconfigure and how your data is stored.

After you configure the module, click the "Install Now" button to add it to the selected brain. The installation process can take a while.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the free plan, you can only install modules in the one extra runtime you get, and not in the default runtime. In the premium plan you can install modules in whatever runtime you want.
{% endhint %}

## Installing Skills

The process of installing skills is relatively similar to the process of installing modules, but for the sake of completeness we'll highlight it again. Just like modules, the same two methods exist for installing skills as well - directly from store and from inside the editor. Let's dive in.

### Directly from store

Let's divide this into three steps -&#x20;

1. Opening the store and finding the skill
2. Selecting a brain to install skill in
3. Configuring modules used by the skill

#### Opening the store and finding the skill

Click on the "Store" link in the left menu of the Maya desktop app to go to store, and then click "Skills" in the category list on the left of the store section (although chances are that it'll already be selected). You will see a list of skills.&#x20;

Click on the skill you want to install and then hit the "Install" button.

#### Selecting a brain to install the skill in

Simply select one of the brains from the given list (it's horizontally scrollable!) - the skill will be installed in the selected brain.

#### Configuring modules used by the skill

Skills are built using modules, so Maya needs to install the modules that the skill depends on. That includes configuring the modules, which is what we have to do in this step. Since it's a sufficiently big topic by itself, we explain module configuration in detail [here](https://docs.mayahq.com/tutorials/configure-modules), including what a configuration profile means, how to reconfigure and how your data is stored.

Once you configure all required modules, click on "Install Now" to finally install the skill.

### From inside a brain

Just like modules, skills can also be installed without leaving the brain editor, in pretty much the same fashion as modules. Since we're doing this from inside a brain, we no longer need to select a brain to install the skill in during the installation process. The steps are -&#x20;

1. Opening the store and finding the skill
2. Configuring modules used by the skill

#### Opening the store and finding the skill

Click on the "Menu" button at the top right of the editor, click on store and then select "Skills" (it will probably already be selected) in the categories section to see a list of skills. From here you can filter and search for skills just like we did when installing directly from store.

![Skills that are already installed are highlighted with green borders](../.gitbook/assets/skillfrombrain.gif)

Notice how the brain is automatically selected to be the one you opened the store from.

#### Configuring modules used by the skill

Skills are built using modules, so Maya needs to install the modules that the skill depends on. That includes configuring the modules, which is what we have to do in this step. Since it's a sufficiently big topic by itself, we explain module configuration in detail [here](https://docs.mayahq.com/tutorials/configure-modules), including what a configuration profile means, how to reconfigure and how your data is stored.

Once you configure all required modules, click on "Install Now" to finally install the skill. After this, you can trigger the command bar and use the skill straightaway.
