# Introducing Maya

Maya is a powerful robotic assistant that lets you automate any repetitive task across devices, using our drag-and-drop workflow builder. The more kinds of tasks you automate using Maya, the better it will get at rewiring itself to do those tasks. We think this is the first step to build a machine that can program itself to do any task i.e. a [general-purpose machine intelligence](https://blog.mayahq.com/general-machine-intelligence/).

#### Welcome to our three-step plan :&#x20;

*   **Step 1 : Create a powerful robotic assistant.**

    Build a robotic assistant that a human can rewire in a few minutes or hours to do any task - from quickly navigating websites and scheduling video calls to automating data entry and controlling robotic arms.
*   **Step 2 : Distribute it to everyone on the planet.**

    Bring the power of this robotic assistant to every individual and business on this planet, to help them quickly build automation workflows to automate their tasks and improve their output by an order of magnitude.
*   **Step 3 : Make it more general-purpose over time, **_**ad singularity**_**.**

    Till the point it can recursively self-improve, use the different types of automation workflows created in the process to manually train the assistant to rewire itself in seconds to do more and more kinds of complex tasks for its users.

This has never been built before so we still have a lot of work to do get it right. Please bear with and tell us of any unwanted bugs & wanted features at [humans@mayahq.com](mailto:humans@mayahq.com) or via Maya's feedback section.
